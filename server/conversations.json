The system then tags files containing PII information in the Komprise GFI.\n\nFiles tagged with PII are tiered to AWS Gov Cloud, while those without PII are moved to the regular, cheaper AWS cloud. This setup ensures continuous cost savings that comply with regulations.\n\nIn addition, Komprise offers various other use cases such as AI Ready Data, AI Data Workflows, Analyze Unstructured Data, Cloud File Migration, Cloud Tiering and Archiving, Ransomware Protection, Data Classification, Data Replication, Isilon Migration, Migrate NAS and Object Data, Optimize Cloud Data, and Sensitive Data Management."

This strategy allows for additional benefits such as zero user disruption, a foundation for delivering self-service to line of business teams, and the potential for further savings through Deep Analytics and Global File Index features. The key advantage is that over 80% of data is cold, which can be stored on cheaper storage and does not require the same level of backup and replication as hot data (actively used data). This allows Pfizer to cut 75% of their data storage and backup costs without users noticing any change. You can read more about this in the blog post titled \"Pfizer's Cloud Data Migration.\""

This strategy allows for the offloading of data from expensive storage and backups, as over 80% of data is not actively accessed and is considered cold. The benefits include zero user disruption and a foundation for delivering self-service to line of business teams. Pfizer plans to further leverage Komprise's Deep Analytics and Global File Index to allow authorized research users to search for their own data, copy or move it to locations for analysis. This strategy helps in managing hot data that is actively used and cold data that is rarely used differently, ultimately reducing storage and backup costs significantly without affecting the user experience."
